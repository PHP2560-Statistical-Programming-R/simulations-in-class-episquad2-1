Good job!

For the Problem 3, it would be better to use binomial distribution rather than uniform distribution. And for 3.b, you may try to write a loop to automatically test more probabilities.

No answer for Problem5.

Good job! 

For the **markov chain** problem, the bankroll can be less than 0 since we assume the you cannot go bust. And a fair game means its expectation is 0.

The **boot_ci** function would be better to have the estimating function as a parameter.

Good job!

For problem1.c, the mean needs to be calculated using the time with bankroll less or equal to zero.

The **boot_ci** function would be better to have the estimating function as a parameter.
